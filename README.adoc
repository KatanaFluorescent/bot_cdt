= How to use

This is just a stupid discord bot only three commands are supported for now :

== Commands

``!start``, this command starts a new game

``!guess five_letters_word``, returns the result with this guess

``!stop``, stops the current game and tells you the answer

You can also get this help by typing ``!help_wordle``

== How to setup

First of all, you must create a .env file containing the token of your bot. This file must follow the following syntax :

[source]
----
#./.env
DISCORD_TOKEN="your_token"
----

Then you have two choices : either you just install the required packages and launch the python script, either you use the dockerfile I provide; which just runs the bot in a container. 

For this, you need docker installed (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[here are the docks])

Then, you execute the following lines of code

[source, bash]
----
#in the root of this project
#I choose to tag the image as wordle bot but the name is up to you
docker build -t wordle_bot . 
#replace wordle_bot by the tag you chose
docker run -it wordle_bot 
----

And you're up and running !
